# PQTrades Showcase

Welcome to the official public showcase of **PQTrades Platform**, a full-stack trading simulation platform built to demonstrate scalable backend architecture, real-time infrastructure, and institutional-grade execution logic.

This project highlights my work as a full-stack Quant Developer with a focus on Python, trading system design, and backend-first infrastructure thinking.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**PQTradePlatform** is a real-time quant trading simulator that mimics institutional trading systems. It supports market, limit, and stop orders, real-time PnL, margin tracking, and session-level access control. This platform was designed and developed from scratch over three months to demonstrate production-grade execution logic.

## üß† Key Features

- **Real-Time Price Feed Engine**  
  Simulated bid/ask pricing with OHLC candle generation (M1‚ÄìD1), 8-week delayed configuration for backtesting

- **Trade Execution Engine**  
  Market, Limit, and Stop order handling with SL/TP enforcement, FIFO matching, and PnL calculation

- **Modular Backend Architecture**  
  Django + FastAPI APIs with token versioning, idempotency middleware, session-scoped authentication

- **Frontend Dashboard (SPA)**  
  React + Tailwind dashboard with role-based interfaces for Trader, Admin, and Observer (view-only)

- **Live WebSocket Data Layer**  
  WebSocket + Redis bridge for real-time price updates, execution sync, and background task distribution

- **Deployment Optimization**  
  Runs on AWS EC2 (t2.micro free-tier) with <10% idle CPU via SWAP memory tuning and service isolation


## ‚úÖ Project Outcome

Delivered a full-stack MVP aligned to institutional-grade standards, enabling real-time model testing, execution simulation, and a robust Python backend infrastructure. Demonstrates fluency in system design, modern dev workflows, and real-world quant engineering.
